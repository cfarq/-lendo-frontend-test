# Lendo Test

The data is provided by a file in the backend folder of this app.

You'll probably need to install the backend node packages by navigating to `backend` and running `yarn` or `npm` install

`$ npx nodemon` should start up the backend correctly. It defaults to port `5000`.

Installation for the frontend in the main directory.

`$ yarn install`

or

`$ npm install`

This project is also built with vite.

To start the project

`$ vite dev`

or

`$ npm run dev`
