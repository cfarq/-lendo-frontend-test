# Lendo Test

The data is provided by a file in the backend folder of this app.

You'll probably need to install the backend node packages by navigating to `lendo-test/backend` and running `yarn` or `npm` install. Requires node `18.17.0` and up

`$ npx nodemon` should start up the backend correctly. It defaults to port `5000`.

Once running the backend server should respond with `Server running on port ${port}`

Installation for the frontend in the main directory.

`$ yarn install`

This project is also built with vite.

To start the project

`$ npm run dev`
